# path_visualizer
A path visualizer for graph algorithms BFS, DFS, and Dijkstras in a maze.

## Contents
The project contains visualization of three graph algorithms viz., Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Dijkstras Single Source Shortest Path 
Algorithm. The code is in pure javascript using a OOP design for implementation.

## Contribute
The goal is to learn and create visualizations for learners to understand the algorithms better.
So, Fork the repository to contribute to create more visualization of other algorithms.
